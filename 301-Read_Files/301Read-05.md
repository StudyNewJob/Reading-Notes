## Readings: Putting it all together

### Questions
#### What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?
Each component should do one thing. If a component gets big it should be broken into smaller subcomponents. 
#### What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?
A static version of an application means creating a version that renders the UI from the data model but isn't interactivity.
#### Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?
Interactivity.
####What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?
* Is it passed in from a parent via props? I
* Does it change over time?
* Is it based on any other state or props in your component?

#### How can you identify where state needs to live?
```
console.log(x === y ? true : false);
```
