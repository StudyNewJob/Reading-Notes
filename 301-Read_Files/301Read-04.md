## Passing Functions as Props

### Questions
#### What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
A controlled component is a component that derives its input value from the state. 
#### Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
Update the state as soon as the user enters their responses. It provides;
* Real-time Validation
* UI Responsiveness
* Consistent State Management
#### How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
On an input field you can target what the user is entering using the event object provided to the event handler function. 
#### Why would we use a ternary operator?
* It reduces the amount of code needed for simple conditional logic.
* It's useful for inline conditional rendering in JSX.
* It can be more readable than a full if-else statement.

#### Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:
```
console.log(x === y ? true : false);
```

## Things I want to know more about
Why not just use normal function syntax?
