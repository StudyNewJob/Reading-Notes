# Read: 05 - Design web pages with CSS
**C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heets is where webpages start to become fun. You can begin adding elements like color more easily and create a better flow for your webpages.

### 1. What is the purpose of CSS?
**CSS is used to styleweb pages like to changing the font, color, size, and spacing of your text**
```css
body {
  background-color: lightblue;
}

h1 {
  color: navy;
  margin-left: 20px;
}
```
Body tells that all elements with the body tag will have a background color of light blue.
h1 tells that all elements with the h1 tag will be colored navy blue and have a left margin of 20px.

### 2. What are the three ways to insert CSS into your project?
* inline
* internal
* external

#### Inline
  ```css
  <h1 style="color:blue;text-align:center;">This is a heading</h1>
  <p style="color:red;">This is a paragraph.</p>
  ```
Inline CSS is done "in line" with an element.

#### Internal
```css
   <style>
    body {
      background-color: linen;
    }

    h1 {
      color: maroon;
      margin-left: 40px;
    }
    </style>
```
Internal CSS is done at the top of an html document and defines elements throughout a particular page.

#### External
```css
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<link rel="stylesheet" href="mystyle.css">
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```
This shows the html document referencing an external CSS document that defines how elements are displayed on the page.

### 3. Write an example of a CSS rule that would give all <p> elements red text.
```css
<style>
  p {
    color: red;
  }
</style>
```
