So true story, I've been wanting to properly get into being a dev or at least working in appsec, closer to the code and expanding my skillset, for a while. But one of the many thing I didn't understand, among containers, was git and version control.

### 1. What is Version Control?
Version control is the process of managing and keeping track of changes to source code.

### 2. What is cloning in Git?
Cloning is copying a repository to another location so that it can be worked on.

### 3. What is the command to track and stage files?
**git add \<insert name of modified file\>**

### 4. What is the command to take a snapshot of your changed files?
**git commit \<insert filename\>**

### 5. What is the command to send your changed files to Github?
**git push origin main**
