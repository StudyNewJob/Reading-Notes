Todays primary topic will deal with learning markdown.
  
## What is Markdown?
Markdown is a lightweight markup language that can be used to format plaintext.

## Why do we use Markdown?
Markdown makes it easier for web designers to work with text heavy pages such as articles when most work on the web is done in HTML and JavaScript

## What symbol will create a heading in Markdown?
Headings are controled by the hashtag, pound, or octothorpe symbol "#"
\# is the H1 heading
# Heading
\## is H2 heading
## Heading
\### is the H3 heading
### Heading

## How many do you need to create the largest heading?
The largest heading, the H1 heading, requires a single octothorpe
"#"

## How many do you need to create the smallest heading?
H6 is the smallest heading in markdown and as a result requires six octothorpes
"######"

## When making text bold or italicized for emphasis, it is best practice to use which symbol?
Bold and Italics are controlled largely by the asterisk "*" . You can also use underscores "_"
This is \*italics\*
This is *italics*
This is also \_italics\_

Bold uses \**two\** asterisks.
Bold uses **two** asterisks.

For best practices, though underscores do work, it's better to simply use asterisks. Some application don't agree on how to handle underscores in the middle of words.

## How do you create a link with Markdown?
You can creat links by blocking the link text in a pair of brackets \[ like this \] and the link destination in a pair of \( parenthesis \).

## What are the three symbols you can use to create an unordered (bulleted) list with Markdown?

### Thoughts
I had heard of markdown but never really understood what it was. There's a note taking program called Obsidian that uses it and much of the power related to how that note app works is how markdown works and now I can do markdown I can use that app to a greater potential.
