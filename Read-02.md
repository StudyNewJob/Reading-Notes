The console and text editors are the main way a programmer is able to interact with their computer and it's environment in order to create computer programs.  

### What are four important features to look for in a text editor?  
First a text editor is a piece of software that you download and install on a computer to edit text. For programmers this lets them write programs.  

### What do the following commands do?  
Below is a list of commands from the Linux operating system. While the commands may not be universal to other operating systems  
such as windows, there are likely equivalent commands.  
**pwd:** PWD means Print Working Directory. It shows what directory you're working from on a computers file system.  
**ls:** Ls means LiSt lists the files and folders within the working directory.  
**cd:** Cd means Change Directory. It changes the working directory.  
**mkdir:** Mkdir means MaKe DIRectory. It makes a directory.  
**touch:** Touch makes an empty file.  
### Can you explain what is happening in the following scenario if these commands and arguments are entered into the command line? (Arguments are extra instructions given to a command.)
##### **cd projects**  
If there is a directory in the current working directory **"cd projects"** will change the working directory to **"projects"**.  
##### **mkdir new-project**  
The above command will create a new directory named **"new-project"** in the current working directory.
##### **touch new-project/newfile.md**
##### **cd ..**
