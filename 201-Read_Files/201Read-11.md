# Read: 11 - Programming with JavaScript
Javascript is a very powerful language but there are more parts to it than previously covered.

## Introduction
**Control flow is the order in that computer executes code.**

### 1. Explain how the ability to use video and audio on the web has evolved since the early 2000s.
Video used to be done with a variety of plugins like flash. However it wasn't very secure. With the advent of HTML5, new tags were added that were better able to process video and audio.
### 2. Describe the use of the src and controls attributes in the <video> element.
* src: Provides the path to the actual video
* controls: determines whether or not the viewer of the page will have the capability to start and stop the video.
### 3. Why is it important to have fallback content inside the <video> element?
For accessibility reasons. Not all browsers support certain video types. So it can provide a way to view the video should an older browser be unable to display it.
### 4. Write a very short story where <audio> and <video> are characters.
Once upon a time on the internet, there were two friends, <audio> and <video>, who lived on a webpage. \<audio\> was a musician, always behind the scenes, enchanting the users with their tunes. \<video\>, on the other hand, was a storyteller. They painted moving pictures and captivating hearts with his vivid tales. Together, they brought life to the static world of HTML.
### 5. How does Grid layout differ from Flex?
* Grid is two dimensional. It's meant to handle rows AND columns.
* Flexbox is one dimensional. It only deals with vertical OR horizontal. Not both.
### 6. Grid container, grid item, and grid line are a few important terms to understand when using Grid. Please describe these terms in a few sentences
* Grid Container: Displays the grid. It's the parent element that contains and organizes the grid items into a layout.
* Grid Item: The children of the grid container. These are the elements that are laid out on the grid defined and organized by the grid container.
* Grid Line: The dividing lines that make up the structure of the grid. They can be either vertical or horizontal .
### 7. Besides making a site visually appealing across different screen sizes, why should developers make images responsive?

Nowaday people view webpages on many different devices. Trying to maintain the same layout on a smaller or larger screen or one with a different aspect ratio would be problematic without responsive imagery.

### 8. Define the following <img> attributes srcset and sizes. Write an example of how they are used.
