## About Me:

Hey! My name is Shama. I'm a US Army veteran and cyber security professional who's making the addition/skill addition of programming and swe to my professional skill set.

For me the growth mindset means striving to be the best versions of ourselves every day.

How do I remind myself?

1. Never give up
2. If today was bad tomorrow has the chance to be better
3. Learn something new every day
